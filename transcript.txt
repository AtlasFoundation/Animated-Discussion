Lisa:I get rid of the arguments me to CPMC start you just said something
People:this is the Headless browser issue that causes
People:it's chocolatey socks yeah
Ajax:trying to continuously open app permission browser window to do the fucking socks thing
People:this is like I also all not new but this is exactly what I make it looks like when it ran proper
Lisa:accessing the audio States problematic like Omega basically does this constantly and just ungracefully X's out while it's listening
Ajax:and actually if I had bothered to do logs you be able to see what it's doing right now which is like kind of probably hilarious
Lisa:oh you can't X out of it actually until you like get to this a God I remember having to do this before
Ajax:you should only click into the window and get the thing to let you
Ajax:if you get it in between the right guy
Lisa:yeah this is how we ran a mega like this for like a year
Lisa:I know I know I know I've been through all of this you would think that but it has to do with the audio and the package from headless won't let you do a bunch of things and Puppeteer has issues I think we ended up switching this is exact reason I was suggesting a different speech architecture
People:could you this wrecking everything pretty much to do the calls this is something I don't think he just knows he's doing and turns his visit
People:oh yeah
Ajax:like bitterly this is like we're unfamiliar territory now like I've seen this all before this is like close to running
Ajax:yeah that's why I'm suggesting that we just get rid of whatever he's using to do this and go a different way
People:it's impressive for a life during test that you like code of all junk.
Lisa:well and it's like we'll talk to you if we put it in an environment this is like a sufficient State through a mega to be a functional talking but I'm trying to get it to do logs right now cuz I know I don't have to but I think it's going to be funny cuz I think it's doing a whole set of shit right now
Lisa:Republic
Ajax:I know you can use it you just have to time it so he hid it in between
Ajax:will you can just barely without rebooting type in enough of the letters in enough time with your quick
People:be able to log what is happening and yes this is literally like this entire time I was running it it's like was doing this in the background
People:yeah I'm a patient woman
Ajax:I'm not confused about what chocolate is it's a window specific package manager and I just switched to 12 and it's clearly not functional in Windows
People:did I need it to do that that badly
People:but it doesn't if I'm going to Jason's for speech raining not do sucks
Lisa:yep
Lisa:does that matter
People:it's also the shim Jen things it's going to be partly the image generator
Lisa:Manhattan Killer by the way it's time to chill
Lisa:on your machine
Ajax:what the fuck I can beat you in a timeline machine I can't see
People:it was from my machine how do you see it on my machine
Ajax:if you cannot debuggable this way but you can do it just slowly
Ajax:it's weird to sleek
Ajax:get on with some of these just conversations and like current events it's like I always get this late
Lisa:I don't know Deja Vu or like a police fucking been here before kind of things so it's like in some ways it feels just like we've progressed but in other ways it's like
Ajax:with Blake progressed but it's just this weird kind of like in calculator website what time. This is mimic exactly
Lisa:exactly
People:I think the only other time I remember hearing about the fax was a time wave zero or something like that
People:vaguely recall
People:never heard of it I don't think
Ajax:from what time. Is that I want to say like a 70s or something have 20 at least do something like that kind of remember now
People:it's been like 10 years since
People:oh there we go get Hub topics
Lisa:the Omni way there we got something small yet powerful library to calculate a Time wave up to the initial Point original yeah Terence McKenna and Peter Mayer
Lisa:like is a concept call me when you can catch up on Wave
Ajax:yeah the original time-wave zero software can be found in Cranston Dennis on his cell phone invisible landscape mind hallucinogens and I Ching
People:fractal time-wave.com
People:I think I have heard of this before
People:yeah I feel like you would have stumbled upon it
Lisa:I just don't think I liked it cuz it was like the whole fucken
Ajax:yeah I know yours found the more Tokyo
Ajax:yeah
Ajax:we'll see
People:and I see Nick and the chat is another electric University of Duty released interested in
Lisa:are there so cool video they did on that. Thank you for calling the time and it's a talk with Terence McKenna the chaos mathematician that came up with the teaching part in the function we into a gas and and they're all very stoned and it's called the trial logs and they like have an open discussion that just wanders all over the place from Blake the Sunday pipe offices to the novelty wave in the potential of the universe
People:available on sheldrake. Org
Ajax:is a couple parts in at some point they returned from a break-in are clearly in a different state of mind it's
Lisa:I guess the difference is like I'm just not in bed like I'm probably over-caffeinated but that's the extent of them I like
Lisa:Colton cook like drug consumption so I can go off on these tangents like completely fucking like
Ajax:yeah so now I have to let you know I do any of that did it talk some crazy fucking like shit so
Lisa:because Tony Richard Lisa that I figured out like a little ratio that I kennel was missing in my like whole fractal time like mathematics cell
Lisa:I have like the math like basically figured out for like a fractal time unit
Lisa:so
Lisa:that corresponds with like the Mayan calendar
Lisa:is there any good beat yet is there a face sheet for like underlying I'm thinking time crystals and that kind of stuff like a symmetry art symmetry breaking and you're lying your messages
People:no it's nothing that crazy
Ajax:it's just like just a way to subdivide time and real simple
People:like ratios and
Ajax:stuff like that it's not like crazy talk it's pretty simple
Lisa:it's a
Lisa:it's a little late so I'm not like feeling like getting all talkative about it but
People:basically it's just a ratio and you just subdivide to like any time interval
People:by basically 13 but the nurses overarching this ratio that I'm talking about that
Lisa:is it's repeating over and over but then
Lisa:you know it all infinitely gets sub / 13 intervals that's like the basic like non talkative
Ajax:idea but it's based on the Mayan calendar and like their their timekeeping system because they actually had like a fractal view of timekeeping and so I've just been kind of like chew on it for a long time and I overlooked a ratio a long time ago and it's like the other day I was like looking at some stuff and it's like totally dawned upon me like dude it's fucking right in front of your face like the ratio
Lisa:and so
Lisa:McKenna
Ajax:had a little Epiphany on how to
People:that's like the short
Lisa:diversion
People:what do you mean whatever
Ajax:idea whatever is
Lisa:yeah that is a really cool church so they can I use 1320 daymont say soon and then the I do think that there's is easier to understand is if as a representation of the geometry because you have all these interlocking circles basically their mirroring kind of the orbits and you like there's I know that there's a lot more complex and having a solar and lunar one that are intermittent corresponding
Lisa:yeah see that's the thing that like maybe that's part of the approach or constraint is Lake first of all the Mayan timekeeping they had a heliocentric timekeeping method but their overall
Ajax:that was just a practical calendar for them there there actual timekeeping system was not heliocentric at all
People:and said that's like been the problem that I've been trying to going to
Lisa:solver whatever or
People:figure out our kind of whatever figure out the algorithm as far as them translating their this non heliocentric part of their system into our system in like a very in a
People:easy Lake translation kind of like formula so
People:I like figure it out like the ratio and take kind of like
Ajax:was like the missing piece of this thing that I've been trying to like mess with for a long time still
Lisa:I was hoping to be some like interesting number but it's really nice I mean it's like the interesting part is now when you start mapping it to actual events and then see correlations
Lisa:yeah
People:it's like
Lisa:I mean
People:like for instance you not like 19th June 1st 1970 like that falls on like a particular I forget all the time
Lisa:it's like the what was it
People:it seems like in the Mayan it's like 1970s fell on the planetary cycle like towards the end of the plane planetary cycle
Ajax:and still like there's useful like values that like you want to like attacked first because those are like all agreed upon like you know moments in time or whatever and so that's like some of the stuff that I want to do first is that
People:anyway Bitcoin fits into it to go off on that tangent but
Ajax:Bitcoin was created during the
Ajax:the
Ajax:50 day
Ajax:Galactic cycle on the Mayan calendar
Lisa:and then Excedrin
Ajax:or the other
Lisa:the hall.
Lisa:The paper was released at the
Lisa:the whooped actually
People:it's like the fifth day planetary cycle which was like right before the end of the fifth day of the planetary cycle it was like less than like
Lisa:less than like 10 days before the end of the planetary cycle is when the white paper was released
People:cancel it but it's later
Lisa:add blocker
Lisa:right and then Satoshi left her disappeared
Ajax:at the end of Othello late so I could be a little outfit at the end of the first day
Ajax:Galactic underworld like that's the it's a little late my memory can be off but
Lisa:so late Bitcoin like fits into all this stuff they're like it because it's part of creation like that the time keeping the Mayan timekeeping is just measuring the progression of
People:like creation itself and so everything fits into the Mayan calendar system which is the matter of like
Lisa:figuring out where because these Cycles repeat it's like it's just a matter of
People:figuring Waltz like I have like my rough like translation kind of like formula and like that's the one good thing about like Google and apple is you can mainly like Google but Apple recently added in the last whatever like year I would say maybe in the last couple years and so prior to that when I was like trying to like figure this stuff out these calendar apps didn't go back in history furnace but now that they're they've added more functionality to it you can actually plug in dates like hundreds of years ago and then you can up like and then you can do custom repeats and stuff now the custom repeat stuff is in a
People:to do is use the math and generate calendar event instead of like manually plugging in like certain dates that I kind of like chewin on it's just literally use the math to generate and populate calendar dates and be like this is this day is this interval this day is this like excetera excetera and soap just literally like mathematically populate the calendar and soap instead of submit manually doing it just having a freaking program like generate the calendar dates so that there hopefully more precise from like a algorithmic standpoint but also just moving the
Lisa:tedium of manually entering them so
Ajax:yet there's a project might be interested in I met a guy on the app who's he's called the human calculator and he can still beat the computer at doing like specifically counting algorithm stuff and he traveled back and forth on dates like he he tell you you know what day you were born like what day of the week it wasn't that kind of thing and he made a calendar that's a whole year calendar on a single page and that might be injured
Lisa:Stinger useful to look at just kind of from that perspective that you're thinking of like a more holistic system and it seems like he was taking kind of a geometric approach to time and he likes suddenly realize that he could display all the things on a much smaller format if he just rearranged the way these thinking of it or you need to talk to you yeah
People:I'll Google that thank you
Lisa:me and Gabby Superfast 97 in towns he's like doing is you saying where you're generating all this in advance like he's kind of navigating these geometric spaces in his mind bringing you know he's doing complex math but he's in his head he says he's counting like he's doing stepwise from one you know the number to the other in like fuel to space kind of
Lisa:yeah that's interesting I'll look at that
Ajax:does he actually have the human calculator.com Scott flansburg is absolutely fascinating it's recorded on my profile somewhere and like I was asking him about like how do you what does it feel like when you're doing this when you're trying to do these calculations and he got really interesting he got into Tesla and 369 and stuff as well in his mind I think it is very much like a
People:I think I found it on Facebook
Lisa:Elementary School
Lisa:yeah his system has a leak in though
People:his system as a l like a leap day or a leap year which tells me that it's
Ajax:fly. Right off the bat if you need if you need to do anything like that then that's flooded so
Lisa:but I'll still check it out it all on one page
Ajax:yeah I remember seeing this before in one or both of them were more accurate than the modern calendars and did not require the LIE. They were adjusting
Ajax:differently if it had to do with like the way I think the 20-day months
Lisa:no I'll check it out I'm not trying to like poo poo at her butt
People:if you have to make an adjustment like that that means that your accounting is off in some way so where the Mayan calendar doesn't
Ajax:have to do that cuz it's not like a heliocentric model
Ajax:which is good when you go to Alpha Centauri and want to have kids
Lisa:another Loose Cannon linked to this in modern Computing Paradigm the earliest I could be wrong in this instance I could find of the word computer was computadora which was apply to think
People:want to see Nicholas but it was a priest who is beastly calculating the date of Easter they got it wrong one year and so Easter fell on a Monday and it caused a huge uproar in the Kingdom there's a complete failure cycle stuff will be so the Easter will fall on Sunday and yeah
People:dyed fake Libra call that story or whatever
Lisa:now when I hear that I just think of cryptonomicon and a bunch of prisoners being forced to calculate ciphers
People:do you like things I have that book somewhere I think so it's just that there's a great book I've actually listen to it twice
People:did I have I have like a fucking I mean it's pretty much a gold base crypto but got all that
Lisa:I was looking through my shit and
Ajax:it's like if I even have like some thinking it was some like I don't know it was like some crypto like
Ajax:record that somebody fucking like produced like a lot like whenever I go I forget the name of it was like I was digging through my shit and I saw it and I was like what the
Lisa:it was like African music
People:it was I forget it was like it
People:it was probably like one of the beetle like first looking like CDs or something that was like cool and fool like Crypt of the fucking it even had like some Slick Rick do in the name of the fucken record right I just totally fucking forget the name of it of an
People:it's just like you're my shit
People:I don't know where it's at
Lisa:and a box somewhere healthy
Lisa:fractal Coronavirus
People:we're going to have to figure it out to get off this planet
Ajax:if we don't figure it out we won't be able to like
People:get off the planet
Ajax:not in a giant Rush simply because it's kind of nasty out there but long-term it does seem like a necessary thing to do
Ajax:I'm definitely not volunteering for the Mars colony just a painful way to die
Lisa:yeah I'm just thinking more like you know
Ajax:human race human species
Lisa:like we have to figure it out
Ajax:cuz I've been chilly we'll have to use it
Lisa:see that's the other people that's the other reason to
Ajax:is
People:which I don't think you're that I think of that
Ajax:things like best I can do is maybe run some stuff on the moon
Lisa:yeah that's its
Lisa:well I mean technically there's a there is a way to do it but
Ajax:it's a lake the
People:that's why like a fractal time be unit
Ajax:will be useful in like interplanetary like Commerce because we will have to be able to time
People:and order like interplanetary transactions and if we don't have like a compatible like time unit then we won't be able to let you know Coca-Cola reach consensus Lake interplanetary without a compatible Lake time unit data
People:is like interlocking between
People:exactly
Lisa:we will wait is that what that's what we're talking about right yes practically we are talking about starting right
People:I just don't like to text gets to like Star Trek e but
People:it's basically the same thing
Ajax:you had me say that's the best way to do it like if you look back on you know the historical things you may lose the language may even lose the simple system if you can tie it to like a Celestial pinpointer then you have kind of an exact date that's just based on the geometry of the Spheres like where everything was at the given time and there's a good example of that on the the Hoover Dam it has a star map of the day it was built like in the I think it's at the face on the concrete and just shows like a map of where where is wasn't relation every time
Lisa:you know there's a cold place in Florida if you're ever in Florida it's called Bok Tower
People:Lakers
Ajax:you can look it up it's like Bok Tower I believe
People:it's a really fucking cold ladies
Ajax:Bok Tower Gardens
Lisa:yeah
Ajax:does the fox say
Ajax:I don't know what that is I just know there's a really that's like one of my favorite places
Ajax:Dark Tower
Ajax:open 365 days a year
People:Bok Towers pool
People:Henry Ford's house
Lisa:in Fort Myers is fucking cool
Lisa:those are two places I would recommend you know you got all the like
Lisa:touristy crap but Bok Towers fucking really cool and if you're in Fort Myers it's worthwhile to
Ajax:is it Henry Ford's house
People:cuz he has like the electric car in the garage
Ajax:Street years
Ajax:is swappa electrolyte in his iron nickel batteries would be good as new
People:and then there's this cool little place in what is it Quakertown Pennsylvania
People:that's where the rosicrucian Czar and there's like a pyramid there
Ajax:I took a cold place
People:yeah I'm actually not that far from you that I've been up there I think twice to do the check out to
People:Soul. Org
Ajax:what are some other cool places
Ajax:the US
Lisa:Etowah in Georgia there is like a mountain and there's still preserved pyramids there didn't get as much press and everything but their massacres were to all so long ago and it looks like
People:Amphitheater Amphitheater
Lisa:I'll post some of y'all might like
Ajax:if you like Earth Works and stuff
Ajax:this guy it was cool
People:like them at his map the mathematics he talks about any here is pretty fucking cool shit
Lisa:it all ties in together
Ajax:add to the playlist
People:maybe feel like sacred geometry or being outside like you know I don't think it's this early a psychedelic thing it's a it's a human thing
Ajax:I like it's also very hard to get things out while under psychedelics resides
Lisa:all right
Ajax:yep more interesting ideas but it's sometimes difficult to translate to
People:any feel pain if you try to like write this shit down like when you come back. It was the most profound fucking thing but it was like
Ajax:do I have a old book it's out of Prince called The Cult geometry and hermetic science of motion and number that's like a cool but
Ajax:cool title
Lisa:yeah doctor exas rally of the leave
People:men's all tore up
Ajax:it's actually like was into that
Ajax:it's kind of like it's a little woozy but
People:it was still one of those kind of like books that I like
Lisa:I like the title like you said and so I kind of like
People:got into it but
People:it just talking about primitive Shades primitive geometry
People:primitive symbols
People:what's that Nikes
People:the 50 secrets of Master craftsmanship is affected by Salvador Dali sounds pretty good
Lisa:the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci that's like the shit right there dude that guy
Ajax:he was eating when you read his writings to get like this under this under tone that he just
People:he was just a man like way fucking Beyond his time and he was just living amongst fucking just the swell of fucking Humanity in like it that you can really kind of like you can get this on your line like
Lisa:play sentiment that he just fucking hated like the people he had the associate himself with just from a practical standpoint
Lisa:but you know the other underlying like thing is like I mean that Alex it's late if he was definitely like it because I think he was probably like homosexual but he was definitely at least like bisexual we could get that like like undertone but just his thinking was just a really cool
Ajax:but that is Salvador Dali stuff was really
Lisa:Waikiki got into him kind of like discusses like his chemistry as far as like creating
Lisa:paint like some of his techniques and stuff
Ajax:interested
People:yeah the 50 secrets of Master craftsmanship
People:yeah you're a very
Lisa:but that
People:it does have excellent produce
Lisa:if you ever in St Pete this Dali Museum in st. Pete Florida
Lisa:to worthwhile
People:the granddaddy those fucking the Barnes collection
Lisa:did that is the fucking like
Ajax:most
Ajax:just Priceless fucking like art collection ever in I mean in the United States I would say at least
People:the Barnes collection
Ajax:I'm looking at it now
Ajax:I think that's right near me The Barnes Museum in Philadelphia
People:it's like I was able to go see it in the original his original like house or whatever
Ajax:before it like the collection was moved to the
Lisa:Philadelphia Museum of Art whatever is Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia 3 minutes from Rodan Museum
Ajax:I imagine it's the worst like
Ajax:going to see even but it was cool like seeing in the original presentation could be at like she had this weird like or where he knows you'd be looking at like a like a Priceless Van Gogh and then it would be surrounded by like weird late
Ajax:like ornaments some shit that were like attached to the wall and stuff like it ain't like he he just had some weird cork we're like he'd have all this other shit like attached to the walls and stuff but then like you know there was a Nick to last or anyting there is just literally like a line like you know 18 in away from the wall and you could literally just fuck in Lake
Ajax:all this shit like without being behind glass or anything did
Ajax:you could just literally fucking like
People:touch it if you wanted to but obviously you didn't want to bet
People:Lake Erie
Ajax:starting to freeze now
Ajax:nearly all the snow has melted
People:so I guess we'll see what happens later today
Ajax:you got some stew cooking
Lisa:did that some student in mind that she was a good
Ajax:student
People:you get some like really like quality like bone broth
Lisa:call logistic and bras and just fucking drink that shit in
Ajax:I've been contemplating a pressure cooker I wouldn't mind making matzo ball soup like my grandmother but that means making the stock from scratch
Ajax:cuz it's only that's the important part
People:what kind of thing does that involve we can't do it the slow cookers like intensive you can just use a slow cooker to essentially rendered all down and then you take all the fat off and use it to make matzo balls
People:the key to my small soup is actually making your own stock and then it all should be lard nose fucking oil should a
Ajax:that's a saying hold fact you have your dinner
Ajax:yeah when it cools down there should be like a half an inch of fat of a top
People:soiree
Lisa:did that shit fucking but keep your ass warmed up man
People:it's also very good for a Colts Jewish penicillin
People:Elsa until you tell your nerves keep you like conducting better
Ajax:I like my nerve signals to go where they're supposed to
Ajax:now she lingers the signal
Lisa:get their back to work on your machine or
Ajax:sidetracked
Ajax:Otis tracking it's transcribing I don't know where its image generating it is due in the windows thing it was doing before of a chocolate calm down and now it's like they believed to be functioning
Lisa:yeah I have no idea why open API gave me that
Lisa:like this is not the desert bands turn it was literally a transcribing some boxing video I randomly clicked up
Ajax:but maybe tomorrow I'll look around trying to hook it up to the
Ajax:unless I can also run that local
Lisa:yeah probably I mean just depends on how much coffee
People:I got plenty of Compu too much of a problem
People:I mean they're making the model similar to that's what the giant thing I think is trying to get to a better models and less time and less space
People:things that like it's a D model where it's it's like
Ajax:it's like distributed fucking
People:I'm freaking the name of that one token that was on East they were trying to do that helped Richard heart was trying to do that before you decided to do this is hard and made hacks
Lisa:remember that my head on liquid intelligence and it was about liquidity in the idea of tokenizing and the Machine learning models and stuff
Lisa:cuz if they're not tokenizing the word count to get the next most frequent word you know there's the setting model and then I forget the other it's the
People:search for primes or I forget the name of that website but it's basically whatever because they plug in whatever your project
Ajax:I want to say it started with a beer or something is what's Eddie at home essentially like the framework with genericized and then you can plug in
People:lots of projects
Lisa:okay another one is the protein folding the folded him stuff and that worked
Ajax:did you see King Tut's tomb
Lisa:but the one thing I miss about like Academia is fucking having access to like a fucking cock computational cluster dude fucking
People:did that's the only thing I miss about fucking
Ajax:that shit to you could like the log into a fucking cluster and just have like a fucking like super computer at your fucking like command line dude
Lisa:this was the thing I was thinking of
People:I got one of the projects of crimes some other things but yeah it did they made it so essentially it is just the genericize grab work do work send results back
Lisa:looks like I still have folded on my machine from back in the day
Ajax:and your Windows 95 but the problem is that like everything kind of works too lazy to start fresh cuz honestly going to start fresh these things go into Linux and the windows will be a VM but
People:granny
Lisa:one of these days Microsoft's going to get off their ass and actually just make Visual Studio Enterprise that works for Linux
People:or I'm going to move on to the jetbrains rider
Ajax:cuz that works on
People:all three platforms is the same interface and pretty damn close if not possibly better than Visual Studio
Ajax:little bit slower that's what I don't like about it cuz it's written in Java
People:she got that overhead
People:did I can't mess of it
Ajax:I got them and fucking yeah well your real programmer I need mine I'm not really I'm just like a mediocre hacked but I just can't get I can't not like it's just like for instance like the stuff I'm doing now it's Sleek you know like I'm on that M1
People:it's like the M ones in the fucking closet like plugged into the fucking router and I just fucking at Shell into it and fucking so that's why I can't get around fucking like just the command line is because I don't like I mean I do stuff on you notes to local computer but it's like everything I'm doing is like it's I'm actually on a fucking fucking closet and I'm not even you know what I'm saying so it's like you know Mike them configuration is fucking portable and I just fucking clone my fucking. Files and
People:do something when I shall into something it's just my
Ajax:you know what I'm saying so that's why I can't like get off the fucking them horses just because it's fucking if I'd stuck with a deadline was kind of like this but yeah I'd I didn't really learn a lot of keyboard shortcuts until like probably five or six years ago I started using them more as I was having tendonitis issues like okay I just use the keyboard
Lisa:yeah
Ajax:I mean I'll still like to share the screen with the mac and you know do some stuff that way but it's Lake
People:you know
Lisa:the crazy part is they won't let you virtualize it's like a WS you can get em one instances now but they literally just have a ton of Mac minis plugged in somewhere
Lisa:right
Lisa:how much is that pricing
Ajax:for like a premium but it is if you want to do continuous integration you kind of have to do it
Lisa:the dude
Lisa:Lake
People:that would be the only reason I'm sucking used PWS I mean technically you can you know
Ajax:I mean you can just spin app like free like emails and just keep uses like free fucking
People:he knows the 30-day trials but
People:or whatever but
People:it'd be nice to have a nice so a map to Dedicated Personnel on demand that can cost you $477 a month
People:is it beefy sound like a beefy use eight physical course
Ajax:okay
People:they don't give you much of a discount either for the like compute saving or instant saving like if I do a three year and only drops the 310 that is not cost effective
People:I mean if you just going to spin it up
People:I guess her like a build fine but don't forget the fucking turn that bitch off
People:I mean like I said I'm just seizing like it's really easy to let that should just slide suddenly have a very expensive bill
Lisa:the trick is to change your credit card number I'm so fucking you just like you know whatever card you plugged in just fucking cancel that bitch so you do know for a fact I need to put a credit card like I haven't and they have a bunch of stuff for like if you write anything open-source if you make it for a couple different things you can get $1,000 worth of credit for a year
Lisa:what cuz I was looking at it from he be moving for a digital ocean and if I can get $1,000 worth of credit like the machine up there and still have access cuz right now it's about $250 a year or something
Lisa:yeah I was looking for a Molex I know there is definitely one for.net open source stuff but I think there's just another one open source and pretty much you just had to like use my GitHub repo the licenses you know I might be a burglar or whatever and you did have to have a credit card attached to the account so when I filled it up the first time I screwed up and forgot I didn't have a credit card number to it
Ajax:so yeah didn't seem very difficult. I don't know if they're still doing it but like I remember looking into a couple years ago like there is some accelerators like you pay five hundred bucks and then you get like tens of thousands of dollars worth of credit
Ajax:distributor reviews get up and you know that pretty much just they should have credits at the end of the month and then yeah yeah. Like the one like if you're with
People:beefing. Like you'll get a quarter million dollars worth of credit
Lisa:Azure for Microsoft also has similar types of deals
Lisa:obviously they want you to build complex infrastructure and then have a continuous bill
Lisa:set verse cell or whatever
Lisa:yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like super fast prototyping I mean maybe Lisa knows more I know that the pleasant playground that. Fun site is a cell site it's just a seasoning to it
People:stbtc that's on here did that
Lisa:I think he works with
Ajax:B fish early they were working together
Lisa:I think most of my website server self
Ajax:I'm pretty sure Zebedee uses it as well for like prototyping
Lisa:I know I've seen it referenced in matter most conversations
Ajax:do you supposed to
Ajax:they sometimes meet her
Lisa:date of Easter
